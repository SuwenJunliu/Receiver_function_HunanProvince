# Background


## Purpose

This is my first project about Geophysics (Receiver function) which is managed in Github. During the research, I found that receiver function is much popular in the inversion of nature eqrthquake, but there is not a complete process of receiver function inversion. So I decided to create a example of receiver function inversion. I hope that every small process during the inversion could be shown in this project.
